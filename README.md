# GitHub Copilot intro resources

Accessing Copilot to begin an evaluation is simple and as there is only a monthly commitment to [Copilot for Business](https://github.com/features/copilot) you can enable Copilot for your pilot team only for the duration of the evaluation.  
If you have any privacy questions etc. there are some useful links at the end of the email or contact your GitHub account team.  In EMEA, we run weekly (every 2 weeks over the summer) demos of Copilot which can be accessed here:  https://gh.io/copilot-intro
 
## Enable Copilot in your Enterprise or Organisation 

Start here:

[Managing your GitHub Copilot subscription for your organization or enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/managing-your-github-copilot-subscription-for-your-organization-or-enterprise)
 
That document will link you to the sign up page (not required if you are licensed under a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement):
 
[Copilot for Business sign-up](https://github.com/github-copilot/business_signup/choose_business_type)
 
If you haven’t already then you will need to link an Azure Subscription to your Enterprise Account which will be used for billing Copilot users:
 
[Connecting an Azure subscription to a GitHub Enterprise/Organisation Account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription)
 
The next step will be to set a policy to enable Copilot on one or more Organisations:
 
[Enforcing a policy to manage the use of GitHub Copilot for Business in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-to-manage-the-use-of-github-copilot-for-business-in-your-enterprise)
 
And then you can assign licenses via the Organisation settings (``https://github.com/organizations/myorgname/settings/copilot/seat_management``):
 
[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-in-your-organization)
 
You can also use a single dedicated Organisation to provide access to Copilot.  Enable Copilot for that Organisation within your Enterprise Account and invite members only when they have been approved for joining the evaluation team.  It doesn’t matter which code the developer is working on as long as they have been assigned a Copilot licence.
